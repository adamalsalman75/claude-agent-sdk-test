## **This Week at Macrospire: Earnings Season Shakeups, EV Demand Questions, and Fed Data Blackout Risks**

This past week (Sept 29 - Oct 6), Macrospire dove deep into two of the market's most closely watched earnings reports—and the results tell a fascinating story about consumer behavior and policy uncertainty heading into Q4.

**Nike's Margin Squeeze Gets Real:** Our coverage of Nike's fiscal Q1 2026 earnings revealed a company navigating serious headwinds. Revenue grew just 1% to $11.72 billion, but the real story is in the margins. Gross profit margin fell to 41.8%—down significantly from the prior quarter's 39.4%—as tariffs, promotional pressure, and weak Greater China performance weighed on results. **Fresh data shows Wall Street is cautiously optimistic:** analysts raised price targets post-earnings (Piper Sandler to $84, Morgan Stanley to $72), but Nike stock sits at $71.18 today—**well below the $81 average 12-month price target**. The market is clearly waiting to see if management's turnaround plan can stick. With operating margins at just 7.5% and analysts projecting Q2 fiscal 2027 revenue around $12.1 billion, Nike needs to prove it can reverse course quickly.

**Tesla's Delivery Beat Masks Bigger Questions:** Our Tesla analysis highlighted a 7% delivery increase to 497,099 vehicles in Q3—beating expectations. But here's what we've learned since publication: **Tesla stock has surged 31% from $340 to $446** over the past month, significantly outpacing the tech sector's 0.34% gain. Analyst sentiment has shifted dramatically, with price targets jumping (Wedbush to $600, Piper Sandler to $500)—the average target is now $477, up from $335 a year ago. The rally appears driven by optimism around Full Self-Driving and AI capabilities rather than core EV fundamentals. With Q2 earnings showing 17.2% gross margins and $1.17 billion net income, investors are betting on Tesla's software future, not just car sales.

**The Fed's Data Dilemma:** Perhaps most important for macro watchers, our piece on potential government shutdown impacts highlighted a critical risk: **a data blackout could scramble Fed decision-making right when it matters most.** With the Treasury yield curve currently showing a normal upward slope (10Y at 4.13%, 2Y at 3.58%—a healthy 55 bps spread), recession fears have eased. But if economic data goes dark, the Fed's November rate decision becomes far more complicated.

**The Bottom Line:** This week's coverage underscores the investment themes dominating Q4 2025—corporate margin pressure, the AI speculation premium, and policy uncertainty.
